# Hallmark

A design skill for AI coding assistants. Makes the UIs they generate look made, not generated.

Hallmark is opinionated, short, and boring on purpose. It encodes a tight set of rules — drawn from the consensus of the anti-AI-slop design field (Anthropic's frontend-design skill, the Claude cookbook on frontend aesthetics, and the 2026 "tactile rebellion" movement) — and refuses to let the model fall back to the defaults every LLM was trained on.

The differentiator: Hallmark insists on **structural variety**, not just visual variety. Two pages by Hallmark for two different briefs should not share the same hero → 3-feature → CTA → footer rhythm. They should feel like different sites, not different colour-swaps of the same template.

## Disciplines that hold across every verb

1. **Pre-emit self-critique.** Before handing back any output, score it 1–5 on six axes — Philosophy, Hierarchy, Execution, Specificity, Restraint, Variety. Anything **< 3** triggers a revision pass.

2. **Honest copy — no fabricated content.** If the user did not supply a metric, do not invent one. Stat-led layouts, comparison rows, and proof bars must use real numbers, a placeholder (`—` plus a labelled grey block, "metric to confirm"), or a different macrostructure. *"+47 % conversion"*, *"trusted by 50,000+ teams"*, and *"10× faster"* are slop the moment they're invented. Same rule for testimonials, logos, and case-study counts.

3. **Locked tokens — no mid-render improvisation.** Once a theme is selected, every colour and every `font-family` declaration in the artifact must reference a named token (`var(--color-accent)`, `font-family: var(--font-display)`). Inline OKLCH / hex / `rgb()` values, or a `font-family: "Some Font"` declaration that bypasses the token block, are not allowed.

4. **Re-drawn chrome forbidden.** Hallmark must not hand-build fake browser bars (URL pill + traffic-light dots), fake phone frames, fake code-block windows (mock title bar + dots wrapping a `<pre>`), or fake IDE chrome. Use real screenshots wrapped in a `<figure>` (with at most a hairline border), or omit the chrome and let the content stand on its own.

5. **Mobile responsiveness — every emit verified at 320 / 375 / 414 / 768 px.** Hallmark's output must render flawlessly at all four widths. The non-negotiables: no horizontal scroll + root `overflow-x: clip` on both `html` and `body`; no two-line clickable text; image-bearing grid tracks use `minmax(0, 1fr)`.

6. **Typography purity — no italic headers.** Headings and display type are always roman (`font-style: normal`). An italicised emphasis word inside an otherwise-upright heading (`Built to <em>think</em>`) is one of the most reliable AI tells; so is an all-italic display face on headings. Carry emphasis with weight, accent colour, or a drawn underline. Italic survives only as *body-copy* emphasis inside running paragraphs.
